# Changelog

All notable, user-visible changes to Reactor Dynamics are logged here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); newest entries on top.

For the dense engineering rationale behind each change (spec deviations, tuning, gate
tallies) see `Blueprint/BUILD_DECISIONS.md` — this file is the skimmable summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **RHR / LPI system rework (PWR).** The Residual Heat Removal system is now modeled as
  the real shutdown-cooling loop that doubles as Low-Pressure Injection:
  - **Hot-leg suction valve with a 400 psi interlock.** `set_rhr {active}` opens/closes the
    RHR hot-leg suction valve. The valve can be opened only below **400 psi (2.76 MPa)** and
    **auto-closes** if primary pressure climbs back above it — the operator must depressurize
    into the RHR band first.
  - **Adjustable cooldown rate via the heat-exchanger flow split.** New command
    `set_rhr_hx {fraction | pct}` routes more or less of the constant RHR loop flow through
    the heat exchanger vs. the bypass, throttling cooldown *rate* without changing total flow
    or coolant inventory.
  - **Single ECCS card mode indicator.** New `eccs_mode` field (`HPI` / `LPI` / `RHR` /
    `off`) is computed engine-side each step to drive one Emergency Cooling card. **RHR** is
    indicated whenever the suction valve is open.
  - **Automated LPI on LOCA.** LPI remains the low-head/high-flow regime of the merged
    HPI/LPI pump curve, armed automatically by the 11.03 MPa Safety Injection signal (the
    LOCA signal) and delivering as the plant depressurizes — no separate operator action.
  - New snapshot fields: `rhr_valve_open`, `rhr_hx_fraction`, `eccs_mode`.

### Changed
- RHR alignment permissive moved from 3.45 MPa to the 2.76 MPa (400 psi) valve interlock;
  the control-layer auto-align setpoint tracks it.
- `set_rhr` now drives the interlocked suction valve rather than a bare active flag; RHR
  heat removal scales with the HX flow split.
- Operator manual reference regenerated; Blueprint docs updated (`M1` §6.9, `CONTEXT.md`
  §6.5/§6.7, `M4b` §3b, `pwr_synoptic_prerequisites.md`).

### Notes
- UI card layout is intentionally left as an open task; the field/command binding contract
  for the ECCS card is documented in `Blueprint/pwr_synoptic_prerequisites.md` §6.2a.
- Save-file compatible: older saves migrate (`rhr_valve_open ← rhr_active`,
  `rhr_hx_fraction ← 1.0`). `set_dhr` / `set_lpi` remain as deprecated aliases.
